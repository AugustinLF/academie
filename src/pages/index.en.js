            '"Top quality teachers" ValÃ©rie, France',
            '"I liked the method used by the teachers, the way they helped improve the performance. The physical preparation given was very useful. I liked working with such excellent professionals. Plus the course was very well taught and very organised." Albert, Spain',
            '"I appreciated that the teachers were available for us, I enjoyed the great number of classes offered every day, private lessons as well as group classes, and the morning exercise (which other workshops I have tried do not offer), and also the fact that having all activities in the same place prevents you from losing time, so that you can have spare time to study by yourself." Christophe, France',
