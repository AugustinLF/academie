                    Dutch baritone Henk Neven is one of the most exciting song interpreters of his
                    generation, having made regular appearances at the Wigmore Hall, Concertgebouw
                    and the BBC Proms, whilst being equally at home on the operatic stage. A
                    recipient of the Borletti-Buitoni Trust Fellowship, he has an ongoing recording

                    received the Dutch Music Prize, the highest honour that the Netherlands Ministry
                    of Culture awards to a classical musician.
